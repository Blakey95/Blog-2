So far I have completely finished my character’s walkcycle and refined it so that it looks better than before. 
I have checked that it doesn’t glitch or anything like that and have exported it as a .swf file as well. 
I have also checked my background to make sure it looks ok. 
I then imported both into Flash and converted them to a symbol of a movieclip. 
I lined up my character so that it is in the centre of the screen and started to type out the code to make him move. 
It still needs a lot of refinement but it’s a start.
